# Custom BPP webhook
This is a custom web hook that hooks into the BPP(Beckn Application Provider). It can recieve and print out data though it can't return results yet(Something about domains). It is written in Express with Node. It can be used when testing as a "mock BPP" instead of the proper MuLearn BPP or as a starting point for new BPP projects.
