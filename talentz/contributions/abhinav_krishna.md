In this app I worked on the backend. I set up some things to mock MuLearn data while the MuLearn Beckn API was being built and set up the backend afterwards. I managed to learn how the API works and I helped my fellow programmers in setting up the developer environment.

Since Beckn had little documentation, it was a team effort in trying to work with this API, we had work together to share any knowledge we had. This was extremly interesting.
