This is the first time I'm coming to a Hackathon. In this app I worked on the backend. I set up some things to mock MuLearn data while the Backend API was being built, though unlike others I tried to remain as close as possible to Beckn specifications. I hand-beckenified `mock-data.json` from the (actual)Mulearn API. I also set up the ChatGPT integration that allows new entrepreneurs and small business owners to set up a dev team without much technical knowledge. I managed to learn how the API works and I helped my fellow programmers in setting up the developer environment and in understanding its API.

During this time I also figured out how the BPP webhook works and set up a small custom webhook, though far from complete.
