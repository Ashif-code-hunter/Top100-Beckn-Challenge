I have contributed in building BAP, BPP, and the Flutter application in front end.

Since this was a completely new concept to me, I have faced many challenges during the developemnet process. First I built a BAP, and didn't work as expected. Then I connected with mentors and clarified things. After that I configured it again, and it worked. But after some time, I've got some issues and couldn't figure it out. Then me and one of my teammate have rebuilt the bap in his system. It has been working now.

The BPP was also having some issues, so we had to redo that also two times. And it's now working.

Then I started building front end application with flutter with one my team mate.

Intially I thought we wouldn't be able to make this happen. But working now, even though it's not perfect.
